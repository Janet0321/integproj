<h2 style="color:GhostWhite;"> What are Graphs ?</h2>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">The link between lines and points is described by a graph, which is a mathematical description of a network. A graph is made up of <br>
points with lines connecting them. It makes no difference how long the lines are or where the points are placed. A node is the name given to each object in a graph.
<br> Graphs are a popular way to visually represent data connections. A graph's goal is to convey data that are too many or intricate to be fully expressed in text 
<br>and in a limited amount of space.  A graph should be utilized if the data displays clear patterns or demonstrates relationships between variables.

<h2 style="color:GhostWhite;">Types Of Graphs :</h2>
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Histogram Graph</b><br>
-  A histogram is a data representation that looks like a bar graph that buckets a variety of outcomes into columns along the x-axis. 
The y-axis may be used to illustrate data distributions by representing the numerical count or percentage of occurrences in each column.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Pie Graph (Circle Graph)</b><br>
- A pie chart is a spherical statistical visual that is split into slices to show numerical proportion. The arc length of each slice in a 
pie chart is proportionate to the quantity it shows.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Flowchart</b><br>
- A flowchart is a diagram that shows how a workflow or process works. A flowchart is a diagrammatic depiction of an algorithm, or a step-by-step 
procedure for completing a job. The flowchart depicts the stages as various types of boxes, with arrows linking the boxes in a logical order.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Bar Graph</b><br>
- A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that uses rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportionate to the values they represent to convey categorical 
data. The bars can be plotted either horizontally or vertically. A column chart is another name for a vertical bar chart.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Line Graph</b><br>
- A line graph is a visual representation of data that evolves over time. A line graph shows a continuous shift in the values indicated by the data points 
by connecting them with a straight line.

<h2 style="color:GhostWhite;"> Why do we use graphs and why are they important ?</h2>
<p  style="color:GhostWhite;"> When you have linked data and want to demonstrate patterns, such as the average night-time temperature for each month of the year, 
you may utilize them. Cartesian graphs include numbers on both axes, allowing you to demonstrate how changes in one item effect changes in another. <br><br>
Graphs and charts are visual representations of data linkages that are meant to make the information easier to learn and remember. Graphs and charts are frequently 
used to illustrate trends, patterns, and connections between collections of data.</p>

<h2 style="GhostWhite;"> How do we use and apply this in our lives ? </h2> 
<p style="color:GhostWhite;"> We use graph theory to solve two real-world network challenges. Modeling sexual interaction networks is the first difficulty, 
whereas criminal networks is the second. For the research of sexually transmitted infections, the structure of an underlying sexual interaction 
network is critical. <br><br>
In real life, graphs may be utilized in a variety of ways. A line graph in the shape of a straight line, for example, denotes a linear connection between two 
values shown on the x- and y-axes. A circle graph can represent the proportion of money spent on various household products over the course of a month.</p>
